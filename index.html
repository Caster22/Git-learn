The secret side of me<br>
I'll never let you see<br>
I keep it caged but I can´t control it<br>
So stay away from me, the beast is ugly<br>
I feel the rage and I just can´t hold it<br>
<br>
It´s scratchin on the walls<br>
In the closet in the halls<br>
It comes awake and I can´t control it<br>
Hidin' under the bed<br>
In my body in my head<br>
Why won´t somebody come and save me from this<br>
Make it end<br>
<br>
I feel it deep within<br>
It´s just beneath the skin<br>
I must confess that I feel like a monster<br>
<br>
I hate what I´ve become<br>
The nightmare´s just begun<br>
I must confess that I feel like a monster<br>
<br>
I, I feel like a monster<br>
I, I feel like a monster<br>
<br>
My secret side I keep<br>
Hid under lock and key<br>
I keep it caged but I can´t control it<br>
Cause if I let him out<br>
He´ll tear me up break me down<br>
Why won´t somebody come and save me from this<br>
Make it end<br>
<br>
I feel it deep within<br>
It´s just beneath the skin<br>
I must confess that I feel like a monster<br>
<br>
I hate what I´ve become<br>
The nightmare´s just begun<br>
I must confess that I feel like a monster<br>
<br>
I feel it deep within<br>
It´s just beneath the skin<br>
I must confess that I feel like a monster<br>
<br>
I, I feel like a monster<br>
I, I feel like a monster<br>
<br>
It's hiding in the dark<br>
It's teeth are razor sharp<br>
There´s no escape for me<br>
It want's my soul it want's my heart<br>
<br>
No one can hear me scream<br>
Maybe it's just a dream<br>
Maybe it's inside of me<br>
Stop this monster<br>
<br>
I feel it deep within<br>
It´s just beneath the skin<br>
I must confess that I feel like a monster<br>
<br>
I hate what I´ve become<br>
The nightmare´s just begun<br>
I must confess that I feel like a monster<br>
<br>
I feel it deep within<br>
It´s just beneath the skin<br>
I must confess that I feel like a monster<br>
<br>
I'm gonna lose control<br>
It's something radical<br>
I must confess that I feel like a monster<br>
<br>
I, I feel like a monster<br>
I, I feel like a monster<br>
I, I feel like a monster<br>
I, I feel like a monster<br>
